● The tests can be created in MCQ(Multiple Choice Questions) format<br />
● All the tests are real time and the start and end time of the test is decided by the
owner.<br />
● During the active interval, the student can click on the attempt test button.<br />
● A countdown timer shows how much time is left.<br />
